# Our CTF Platform

This is the platform that was used to host the **Capture the Flame** Mini-CTFs throughout the Spring 2026 school semester. Created to easily host challenges in a dynamic environment, this platform was used to host the events: 
- Caught the Lovebug  
- Ignite the Flame
- Into the Flame  
- Byte the Flame  

Each hosted event last 2 hours, allowing this platform to become our new go-to for easy maintenance. 

Our platform was used with a **manual** user registration system over a **vercel frontend** + **railway backend** for the first two events, with two being implemented with migration to **creator managed servers** paired with **Google OAuth Login**.

**Originally** intended for use in the mini competitions, this website was used as the foundations for the **Capture the Flame 2027** CTF platform.

## How was it used?

The platform was deployed to host the various mini competitions, allowing for the **Capture the Flame team** to 
- **Reliably** distribute callenge files  
- **Validate** user input  
- **Monitor user issues** in real time  
- **Customize** the UI while retaining the core functionality of site per event

<br>

Each event contained a **varying color theme** that was used by **forking the main branch** (the template branch)

After each event, the deployed sites were left up, all students to participate despite not being at the event. Also, allowing the team to gauge student participation.
